vector has a method called swap() which is the fastest way to swap elements between two vectors.

    it is faster than assignment

    internally every vector strores 3 info
    1 /
    pointer to a dynamic array
    2 /
    size of the array
    3 /
    max capacity

    swap() simply swaps these 3 elements in O(1) without swaping element by element

    two vectors v1,
    v2

    swap(v1, v2)
work exactly same as v1.swap(v2) because swap(v1, v2)
is defined as v1.swap(v2) internally

    to empty a vector
    or clear a vector,
    vector<int>().swap(existing vector)
