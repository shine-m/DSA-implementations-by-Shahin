decision : 
source of observation : codeforces round 1009 div - 3

1)
                    x^y + 2*(x&y) 

x⊕y gives the sum without carry, and  2(x&y) adds the carry effect back in

2)
                   x+y > x⊕y

Intuition: The sum of two numbers is always greater than their XOR because XOR only adds bits where one of the numbers has x 1, but ignores carry bits.

x+y includes the carry from addition, while  x⊕y does not.
